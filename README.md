# Predawn
###A dark interface and syntax theme for Sublime Text, previously called **Flatland-Alt**.

## About

Predawn is a minimal Sublime Text theme and a syntax color scheme. It was originally just a slightly tweaked version (called Flatland-Alt) of the [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) theme, which itself is a flat reworking of [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/). I decided to keep going with cusomization and rework the entire theme. But I owe a lot to Flatland and Soda. Thanks guys!
